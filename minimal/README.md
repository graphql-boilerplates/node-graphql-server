## Features

- **Scalable GraphQL server:** The server uses [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) which is based on Apollo Server & Express

## Documentation

### Commands

* `yarn start` or `npm run start` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000`

> **Note**: We recommend that you're using `yarn dev` during development as it will give you access to the GraphQL API or your server (defined by the [application schema](./src/schema.graphql)) as well as to the Prisma API directly (defined by the [Prisma database schema](./generated/prisma.graphql)). If you're starting the server with `yarn start`, you'll only be able to access the API of the application schema.
